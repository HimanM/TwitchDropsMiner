# Twitch Drops Miner by HimanM

A personalized fork of Twitch Drops Miner focused on desktop use, Linux/headless use, and a portable terminal interface.

The miner advances Twitch drop progress without playing video. It logs in to Twitch, discovers campaigns, picks eligible channels, switches channels when needed, and claims drop progress in the background.

## Features

- GUI build for normal desktop use.
- DropForge Web UI for authenticated, image-rich Linux server control from desktop or mobile browsers.
- Terminal UI through `tdminer`.
- Portable CLI mode for headless Linux, SSH sessions, Termux source installs, and terminals where full TUIs are awkward.
- Twitch device-code login for terminal sessions.
- Saved login through `cookies.jar`.
- Campaign discovery and drop progress tracking.
- Game priority and exclusion lists.
- Automatic channel selection and manual channel switching.
- Optional unlinked-drop farming for the Twitch linked-account display bug.
- One-command Linux Web UI or CLI installer with in-place updates and persistent data.

## Desktop Install

Download the latest release from:

https://github.com/HimanM/TwitchDropsMiner/releases

Unzip it, run the app, log in, then use the Settings tab to configure priority/excluded games.

Persistent files such as `cookies.jar`, `settings.json`, `lock.file`, `cache/`, and logs live next to the executable or inside the app bundle, depending on the platform.

## Linux Server Install

Run the installer and choose the Web UI or CLI when prompted:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HimanM/TwitchDropsMiner/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

The first Web UI install prints a generated admin password and recovery code, then asks whether to bind to localhost or `0.0.0.0`. Localhost is recommended and selected by default. Re-running the same command updates the selected interface while preserving the bind choice, Twitch cookie jar, settings, admin credentials, recovery data, and browser sessions under `~/.local/share/tdminer/data`.

For private remote access while keeping the app on localhost, install Tailscale and run:

```sh
tailscale serve --bg http://127.0.0.1:17473
```

To expose the port directly on every network interface instead:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HimanM/TwitchDropsMiner/main/scripts/install.sh | TDMINER_HOST=0.0.0.0 sh
```

The installer remembers the selected interface. For unattended installs or to switch later:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HimanM/TwitchDropsMiner/main/scripts/install.sh | TDMINER_MODE=web sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HimanM/TwitchDropsMiner/main/scripts/install.sh | TDMINER_MODE=cli sh
```

Web service commands:

```sh
tdminer-web status
tdminer-web start
tdminer-web stop
tdminer-web restart
tdminer-web logs
tdminer-web reset-password
```

Stopping `tdminer-web` stops both the Web UI and mining. Starting it again resumes the saved installation and Twitch session.

To uninstall the default Web UI installation while keeping `~/.local/share/tdminer/data` for a later reinstall:

```sh
sudo systemctl disable --now tdminer-web.service
sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/tdminer-web.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
rm -f ~/.local/bin/tdminer-web
rm -rf ~/.local/share/tdminer/releases ~/.local/share/tdminer/current
rm -f ~/.local/share/tdminer/install-mode ~/.local/share/tdminer/web-host
```

If the installer opened port `17473` in UFW, remove that rule too:

```sh
sudo ufw delete allow 17473/tcp
```

For a complete uninstall, including the Twitch cookie jar, settings, web password, recovery data, and browser sessions, also run:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.local/share/tdminer
```

The last command permanently deletes all DropForge data. If `TDMINER_INSTALL_DIR` or `TDMINER_APP_DIR` was customized during installation, use those paths instead.

Passwords and recovery codes are salted and hashed with scrypt. Session cookies are opaque, HttpOnly, and cleared on website logout. Website logout does not stop mining or clear the Twitch cookie jar. Binding to `0.0.0.0` uses HTTP, so use it only on a trusted network; localhost plus Tailscale Serve is recommended for private HTTPS remote access.

macOS terminal install uses the same command and installs the latest release asset.

Custom install location:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HimanM/TwitchDropsMiner/main/scripts/install.sh | TDMINER_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/bin" sh
```

Termux:

```sh
pkg install python clang curl tar
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HimanM/TwitchDropsMiner/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Native Termux cannot run the Linux release binary because Android does not use glibc Linux executables. On Termux, the installer downloads the source, creates a Python virtual environment in `~/.local/share/tdminer`, installs dependencies, and creates a `tdminer` launcher in `$PREFIX/bin`.

## Running

Automatic terminal frontend:

```sh
tdminer
```

Textual TUI:

```sh
tdminer tui
```

Portable CLI:

```sh
tdminer cli
```

Verbose logs:

```sh
tdminer cli --log -vv
```

The terminal login uses Twitch device activation. If login is needed, `tdminer` shows a URL and code. You can open the URL from the UI, copy it, or type it manually on another device for headless systems.

## CLI Commands

The portable CLI has a boxed command input with slash-command autocomplete.

Type `/` to list commands. Type `/priority add `, `/exclude add `, or `/switch ` to autocomplete available games and channels.

Type `/help` in the CLI to view all commands grouped by category with descriptions.

```

## Settings Notes

- Priority mode controls how games are selected.
- Farm unlinked drops only works in priority-only mode.
- Priority and exclude changes require an inventory reload before they affect channel selection.
- Link Twitch campaigns to game accounts on https://www.twitch.tv/drops/campaigns when required by the campaign.

## Security Notes

- `cookies.jar` stores your Twitch session. Keep it private.
- Twitch may send a new-login email after device login. That is expected.
- Avoid watching Twitch in a browser with the same account while the miner is active, because Twitch may report progress inconsistently.

## Source Run

Python 3.10+ is required.

```sh
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-tui.txt
python tdminer.py cli
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements-tui.txt
python tdminer.py cli
```

## Build Notes

- GUI builds use the original desktop packaging paths.
- `tdminer` release binaries are built with PyInstaller.
- Linux release binaries require compatible glibc Linux systems.
- Termux uses source install instead of release binaries.
- For full build and deployment instructions across all platforms, see [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).
